<h1>Begin your new journey with Wanderwise! </i> </h1>

Wanderwise is a .NET web app intended to simplify the process of booking tourist arrangements that are offered by travelling agencies. The client can create their account and make their bookings. The administrator can create Travels that are offered by the Agency, and these Travels can later be booked by Clients. In addition, for each journey there is an option to book a Tourist Guide who acts as an Employer within this system.
